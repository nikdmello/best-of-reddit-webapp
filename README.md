## Overview
A Node.js web app that displays the top posts from any specified subreddit. On the landing screen of the web app, the user can input their desired subreddit as well as the time period of the top posts i.e. from the past 24 hours, past week, etc. The UI was built using Semantic UI and it fetches data from the REST API that I created.

## Frameworks used
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Semantic UI (front-end)

## Instructions (launch app locally)

- Start your app locally using the heroku local command (Heroku CLI must be installed):

The web app should be running at http://localhost:5000/.
