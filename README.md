## Overview
A Node.js web app that displays the top posts from any specified subreddit. On the landing page, the user can input their desired subreddit as well as the time period of top posts i.e. from the past 24 hours, past week, etc. The UI, built using Semantic UI, fetches data from the REST API that I created.

## Frameworks used
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Semantic UI (front-end)

## Instructions (launch app locally)
- [Download and install Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)

```
- Start your app locally using the heroku local command (Heroku CLI must be installed):
```

The web app should be running at http://localhost:5000/.
